Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Dashboard
A web application to manage users, roles, and permissions dynamically. This project demonstrates a functional and user-friendly interface for implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), essential for secure user management in modern applications.

Features
User Management:

View, add, edit, and delete users.
Assign roles to users and toggle their active/inactive status.
Role Management:

Create, edit, and delete roles.
Assign permissions to roles dynamically.
Permission Management:

Manage permissions for roles, including Read, Write, Delete, and more.
Display permissions in a clean and editable tabular format.
Responsive Design:

Fully responsive layout for seamless usage across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
Mock API Integration (Optional):

Simulate CRUD operations for users and roles with mock API responses.
User Experience Enhancements:

Smooth interactions with feedback for actions.
Search and filter functionality for easier management.
Technologies Used
Frontend:
React.js (Functional Components & Hooks)
Material-UI for styling and components
State Management:
React useState and Context API
Additional Tools:
React Router for navigation
Mock APIs for CRUD operations (optional)

How It Works
Users:

Admins can view all users in a table.
Admins can add new users, edit existing users, delete users, and assign roles.
Roles:

Roles can be created, modified, and deleted.
Each role can have a custom set of permissions (e.g., Read, Write).
Permissions:

Permissions are managed via a dynamic table.
Admins can toggle permissions for each role.
How to Add Features
Add New Permissions:

Update the availablePermissions array in the RoleManagement.js file.
Add API Integration:

Replace the mock API logic in UserManagement and RoleManagement with actual API endpoints.
Enhance Design:

Use Material-UI themes or custom CSS for additional styling.
Known Issues
Some edge cases for permission conflicts might require additional validation.
Mock API does not persist data across reloads.
Future Enhancements
Implement role inheritance (e.g., a role can inherit permissions from another role).
Integrate a backend API for real data persistence.
Add sorting and advanced filtering for user and role tables.
